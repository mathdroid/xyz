      "markdown": "##Introduction\n\nInt and unsigned int are approximations to the set of integers and the set of natural numbers. Unlike int and unsigned, the set of integers and the set of natural numbers is infinite. Because the set of int is finite, there is a maximum int and a minimum int.\n\nInts are also contiguous. That is, between the minimum and maximum int, there are no missing values.\n\n####To summarize:\n\n1. The set of valid ints is finite.\n2. Therefore, there is a minimum and maximum int.\n3. ints are also contiguous. That is, there are no missing integer values between the minimum and maximum int.\n\nThere's also another key feature of ints that doesn't appear in the set of integers. ints have an underlying representation. The representation is binary numbers. The set of integers is often represented as base 10 numerals, but is often thought of more abstractly. That is, the set is independent of its representation (i.e., we can represent the set of integers in any way we want).\n\nWhat issues comes up when trying to devise a data representation for floating point numbers? It turns out these issues are more complicated than representing integers. While most people agree that UB and 2C are the ways to represented unsigned and signed integers. Representing real numbers has traditionally been more problematic.\n\nIn particular, depending on which company manufactured the hardware, there were different ways to represent real numbers, and to manipulate it. There's no particularly obvious choice of how to represent real numbers. In the mid 1980's, the need for uniform treatment of real numbers (called floating point numbers) lead to the IEEE 754 standard.\n\nStandards are often developed to give consistent behavior. For example, when C was first being developed, what was considered a valid C program very much depended on the compiler. A program that compiled on one C compiler might not compile on another. Effectively, many different flavors of C were being created, and the need to have a standard definition of a language was seen as important.\n\nSimilar, for purposes of agreeing on results performed on floating point numbers, there was a desire to standardize the way floating point numbers were represented.\n\nBefore we get to such issues, let's think about what restrictions will have to be imposed on floating point numbers.\n\n* Since the number of bits used to represent a floating point number is finite, there must be a maximum float and a minimum float.\n\n* However, since real numbers are dense (i.e., between any two distinct real numbers, there's another real number), there's no way to make any representation of real numbers contiguous. Integers do not have this denseness property.\n\nThis means we need to decide which real numbers to keep and which ones to get rid of. Clearly, any number that has repeated decimals or never repeats is not something that can be represented as a floating point number.\n\n##Scientific Notation\n\nWhy do we need to represent real numbers? Of course, it's important in math. However, real numbers are important for measurements in science.\n\n####Precision vs. Accuracy\n\nLet's define these two terms:\n\n**Definition** *Precision* refers to the number of significant digits it takes to represent a number. Roughly speaking, it determines how fine you can distinguish between two measurements.\n\n**Definition** *Accuracy* is how close a measurement is to its correct value.\n\nA number can be precise, without being accurate. For example, if you say someone's height is 2.0002 meters, that is precise (because it is precise to about 1/1000 meters). However, it may be inaccurate, because a person's height may be significantly different.\n\nIn science, precision is usually defined by the number of significant digits. This is a different kind of precision than you're probably used to. For example, if you have a scale, you might be lucky to have precision to one pound. That is, the error is +/- 1/2 pound. Most people think of precision as the smallest measurement you can make.\n\nIn science, it's different. It's about the number of significant digits. For example, `1.23 * 10^10` has the same precision as `1.23 * 10^-10`, even though the second quantity is much, much smaller than the first. It may be unusual, but that's how we'll define precision.\n\nWhen we choose to represent a number, it's easier to handle precision than accuracy. I define accuracy to mean the result of a measured value to its actual value. There's not much a computer can do directly to determine accuracy (I suppose, with sufficient data, use statistical methods to determine accuracy).\n\n##Accuracy of Computations\n\nThere are two distinct concepts: the accuracy of a value that's recorded or measured, and the accuracy of performing operations with numbers.\n\nWe can't do much about the accuracy of the recorded value (without additional information). However, the hardware does perform mathematical operations reasonably accurately. The reason the computations aren't perfectly accurate is because one needs infinitely precice math, and that requires an infinite number of bits, which doesn't exist on a computer.\n\nSince floating point numbers can not be infinite precise, there's always a possibility of error when performing computations. Floating point numbers often approximate the actual numbers. This is precisely because floating point numbers can not be infinitely precise.\n\nIn the field on computer science, numerical analysis is concerned with ways of performing scientific computations accurately on a computer. In particular, there are ways to minimize the effect of \"round-off errors\", errors that are due to the approximate nature of floating point representation.\n\n##Canonical Representation\n\nWhen representing numbers in scientific notation, it has the following form:\n\n\t+/- S x 10^exp\n    \nwhere S is the significand or the mantissa, and __exp__ is the exponent. \"10\" is the base.\n\nIn scientific notation, there can be more than one way of writing the same value. For example, `6.02 X 10^23` is the same as `60.2 X 10^22` is the same as `602 X 10^21`.\n\nFor any number represented in this way, there are an infinite number of other ways to represent this (by moving the decimal point, and adjust the exponent).\n\nIt might be nice to have a single, consistent way of doing this, i.e. a *canonical* or standard way of doing this. And, so there is such a way.\n\n\t+/- D.FFFF X 10^exp\n\nYou can write the significand as `D.FFF...` where `1 <= D <= 9`, and `FFF...` represents the digits after the decimal point. If you follow this restriction on `D`, then there's only one way to write a number in scientific notation. The obvious exception to this rule is representing 0, which is a special case.\n\nYou can generalize this formula for other bases than base 10. For base K (where `K > 1`), you write the canonical scientific notation form as:\n\n\t+/- D.FFFF X Kexp\n   \nwhere `1 <= D <= K - 1`. The F's that appear in the fraction must follow the rule: `0 <= D <= K - 1`.\n\nThe number of *significant digits*, which is also the *precision*, is the number of digits after the radix point. We call it the *radix point* rather than the *decimal point* because decimal implies base 10, and we could be talking about any other base.\n\n##Binary Scientific Notation\n\nAs with any representation on a computer, we need to represent numbers in binary. So, this means we specialize the formula to look like:\n   \n\t+/- D.FFFF X 2exp\n\nThis creates an interesting constraint on `D`. In particular, `1 <= D <= 1`, which means `D` is forced to be 1. We'll use this fact later on.\n\n##IEEE 754 Single Precision\n\nIEEE 754 floating point numbers was a standard developed in the 1980s, to deal with the problem of non-standard floating point representation.\n\nThere is a standard for single precision (32 bits) and double precision (64 bits). We'll primarily focus on single precision.\n\n##Chart\n\n* *Sign* - 1 bit - b31 - `X`\n* *Exponent* - 8 bits - b30-23 - `XXXX XXXX`\n* *Fraction* - 23 bits - b22-0 - `XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXX`\n\n\nAn IEEE 754 single precision number is divided into three parts. The three parts match the three parts of a number written in canonical binary scientific notation.\n\n* **sign bit** - This is b31. If this value is 1, the number is negative. Otherwise, it's non-negative.\n\n* **exponent** - The exponent is excess/bias 127. Normally, one expect the excess/bias to be half the number of representations. In this case, the number of representations is 256, and half of that is 128. Nevertheless, the excess is 127. Thus, the range of possible exponents is `-127 <= exp <= 128`.\n\n* **fraction** - Normally, you would represent the significant (also called the mantissa. This would mean representing `D.FFFF....` However, recall that for base 2, `D = 1`. Since `D` is always 1, there's no need to represent the 1. You only need to represent the bits after the radix point.\n\nThus, the \"1\" left of the radix point is NOT explicitly represented. We call this the **hidden one**.\n\nIEEE 754 single precision has 24 bits of precision. 23 of the bits are explicitly represented, and the additional \"hidden 1\" is the 24th bit.\nThere is something of a fallacy when we say that a IEEE single precision has 24 bits of precision. In particular, it's very much like saying that a calculator with 15 digits has 15 digits of precision. It's true that it may represent all numbers with 15 digits, but the question is whether the value is really that precise.\n\nFor example, suppose a measured number has only 3 digits of precision. There's no way to indicate this on a calculator. The calculator is prepared to have 15 digits of precision, even though that's more accurate than the number.\n\nThe same can be said about representing floating point numbers. It has 24 bits of precision, but that may not accurately represent the true number of significant bits. Unfortunately, that's the best computers can do. One could store additional information to determine exactly how many bits really are significant, but this is not usually done.\n\n##Categories\n\nUnlike UB or 2C, floating point numbers in IEEE 754 do not all fall in the same category. IEEE 754 identifies 5 different categories of floating point numbers.\n\nYou might wonder why they do this. Here's one reason. Given the representation, as is, there would be no way to represent 0. If all the bits were 0, this would be the number 1.0 X 2-127. Although this is a small number, it's not 0.\n\nThus, we designate the bitstring containing all 0's to be zero.\n\nThe following is a list of categories of floating point numbers in IEEE 754.\n\n* **zero** Because there is a sign bit, there is a positive and negative representation of 0.\n* **infinity** There is also a positive and negative infinity. Infinity occurs when you divide a non-zero number by zero. For example, 1.0/0.0 produces infinity.\n* **NaN** This stands for \"not a number\". NaN usually occurs when you do an ill-defined operation. The canonical example is dividing 0.0/0.0, which does not have a defined value.\n* **denormalized numbers** These are numbers which have fewer bits of precision, and are smaller (in magnitude) than normalized numbers. We'll discuss denormalized numbers in detail momentarily.\n* **normalized numbers** These are standard floating point numbers. Most bitstring patterns in IEEE 754 are normalized numbers.\n\n##How to Tell Which Category a Float is\n\nIt would be useful to know which category a given a bitstring falls in. Here's the chart.\n\n![](/content/images/2015/03/chart-1.png)\n\nAgain, we write `0^8` to mean 0, repeated 8 times, i.e. `0000 0000`.\n\nNotice that there is a positive and negative 0.\n\n##Denormalized Numbers\n\nSuppose that we allowed all 0's to be a normalized number (it's not though, it's really designated as zero).\n\nA bitstring with 32 zeros would be `1.0 X 2^-127`. That's a pretty small value. However, we could represent numbers to get even smaller, if we do the following when the exponent is `0^8`.\n\n* Do not have a hidden 1. `b(23-0)` would be the bits appearing after a radix point.\n* Fix the exponent to -126.\n\nRecall that the exponent is written with a bias of 127. So, you would expect that if the exponent is `0^8`, this bitstring would represent the exponent -127, and not -126. However, there's a good reason why it's -126. We'll explain why in a moment. For now, let's accept the fact that the exponent is -126 whenever the exponent bitstring is `0^8`.\n\n####Largest Positive Denormalized Number\n\nWhat's the largest positive denormalized number? This is when the fraction is `1^23`. It looks like:\n\n**S** | **Exp** | **Fraction**\n\n`0` `0000 0000` `1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 111`\n\nThis bitstring maps to the number `0.(1^23) x 2-126`. This number has 23 bits of precision, since there are 23 1's after the radix point.\n\n####Smallest Positive Denormalized Number\n\nWhat's the smallest positive denormalizd number?\n\nExponent bitstring `0^8`. (All denormalized numbers have this bitstring). It's value is -126.\n\nThe fraction is `(0^22)1`, i.e., 22 zeroes followed by a single 1.\n\nThis looks like:\n\n**S** | **Exp** | **Fraction**\n\n`0` `0000 0000` `0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 001`\n\nThis bitstring pattern maps to the number `0.(0^22)1 x 2^-126`, which is `1.0 x 2^-149`. This number has 1 bit of precision. The 22 zeroes are merely place holders and do not affect the number of bits of precision.\n\nYou may not believe that this number has only 1 bit of precision, but it does. Consider the decimal number 123. This number has 3 digits of precision. Consider 00123. This also has 3 digits of precision. The leading 0's do not affect the number of digits of precision. Similary, if you have 0.000123, the zeroes are merely to place the 123 correctly, but are not significant digits. However, 0.01230 has 4 significant digits, because the rightmost 0 actually adds to the precision.\n\nThus, for our example, we have 22 zeroes followed by a 1 after the radix point, and the 22 zeroes have nothing to do with the number of significant bits.\n\nBy using denormalized numbers, we were able to make the smallest positive float to be `1.0 X 2^-149`, instead of `1.0 X 2^-127`, which we would have had if the number had been normalized.\n\nThus, we were able to go 22 orders of magnitude smaller, by sacrificing bits of precision.\n\n##Why -126 and not -127?\n\nWhen the exponent bitstring is 08, this is mapped to exponent -126. Yet, for normalized IEEE 754 single precision floating point numbers, the bias on the exponent is -127. Why is it -126 instead of -127.\n\nTo answer this question, we need to look at the smallest positive normalized number. This occurs with the following bitstring pattern\n\n**S** | **Exp** | **Fraction**\n\n`0` `0000 0001` `0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 000`\n\nThis bitstring maps to `1.0 x 2^-126`.\nLet's look at the two choices for the largest positive denormalized numbers.\n\n`0.(123) x 2^-127` (exponent is 127)\n\n`0.(123) x 2^-126` (exponent is 126---this is what's really used in IEEE 754 single precision)\n\nBoth choices are smaller than `1.0 x 2^-126`, the smallest normalized (In particular, notice that the number with the exponent of -126 is smaller). That's good because we want to avoid overlap between normalized and denormalized numbers.\n\nAlso notice that the number with the -126 as exponent is larger than the number that has -127 as exponent (both have the same mantissa/significand, and -126 is larger than -127).\n\nThus, by picking -126 instead of -127, the gap between the largest denormalized number and the smallest normalized number is smaller. Is this a necessary feature? Is it really necessary to make that gap small? Maybe not, but at least there's some rationale behind the decision.\n\n##Converting Normalized from Base 10 to IEEE 754\n\nLet's convert 10.25 from base 10 to IEEE 754 single precision. Here's the steps:\n\n* Convert the number left of the radix point to base 2\n\n==Thus, 10[10] is 1010[2].==\n\n* Convert the number right of the radix point to base 2.\n\n==Thus, .25[10] is .01[2].==\n\n* Add the two.\n\n==This results in 1010 + 0.01, which is 1010.01.==\n\n* Write this in binary scientific notation.\n\n==This is `1010.01 X 2^0`, which is `1.01001 X 2^3`.==\n\n* Write this in IEEE 754 single precision.\n\n==This is `1010.01 X 2^0`, which is `1.01001 X 2^3`.==\n\n* Convert 3 to the correct bias. Since the bias is 127, add 127 to 3 to get 130 and convert to binary. This turns out to be `1000 0010`.\n\n* Write out the number in the correct representation\n\n==**S** | **Exp** | **Fraction**==\n\n==`0` `1000 0010` `0100 1000 0000 0000 0000 000`==\n\nNotice that the hidden \"1\" is not represented in the fraction.\n\n##An Algorithm for Writing Positive Exponent in Excess 127\n\nConverting 130 to binary seems a bit painful. It seems to require many steps. However, there's a fairly easy way to convert positive exponents to binary.\n\nFirst, we take advantage of the following fact: `1000 0000` maps to exponent +1 in excess 127. If this were excess 128, it would map to 0. It would be nice, in fact, if it were excess 128, because then we would write out the positive number in unsigned binary, then flip the most significant bit from 0 to 1, and we'd be done. (Verify this for yourself with an example or two).\n\nHowever, excess 127 and excess 128 are only off-by-one, so it's not too hard to adjust the algorithm appropriately. Here's what you do to convert positive exponents to excess 127.\n\n* Subtract 1 from the positive exponent.\n* Convert the number to unsigned binary, using 8 bits.\n* Flip the MSb to 1\n* For example, we had an exponent of 3 in the previous example. Subtract 1 to get 2, convert to UB to get `0000 0010`. Flip the MSb to get `1000 0010`. That's the answer from the previous section.\n\nBefore you memorize this algorithm, you should really try to understand where it comes from.\n\nThis is where it comes from. Consider a positive exponent, `x`, represented in base 10. To convert it to excess 127, we add 127. Thus, we have `x + 127`. We can rewrite this as: (x - 1) + 128. This is simple algebra.\n\n128 is `1000 0000` in binary. And we have `x - 1`, which is where the subtraction of 1 occurs. As long as `x - 1` is smaller than 128 (and it will be, since the maximum value of `x` is 128), then it's easy to add this binary number to `1000 0000`.\n\nRemember, memorization is a poor second to understanding. It's better to understand why something works than to memorize an answer. However, it's even better to understand why something works and remember it too.\n\n##Converting Denormalized from Base 10 to IEEE 754\n\nSuppose you're asked to convert `1.1 x 2^-128` to IEEE 754 single precision. How would you do this? If you're not careful, you might think the number is normalized, and you might convert this to a normalized number using the procedure from before.\n\nYou'd get stuck trying to convert the exponent, because you'd discover the number is negative, and the number has to be non-negative when convert from base 10 (after adding the bias) to UB.\n\nYou can save yourself this hassle if you recall that the smallest, positive normalized number has an exponent of -126, and that the exponent we have is -128, which is less than -126. If you've written the number in binary scientific notation (in canonical form), and the exponent is less than -126, then you have a denormalized number.\n\nSince `-128 < -126`, the number we're trying to represent is a denormalized number.\n\nThe rules for representing denormalized numbers is different from representing normalized numbers.\n\nTo represent a denormalized number, you need to shift the radix point so that the exponent is -126. In this case, the exponent must be increased by 2 from -128 to -126, so the radix point must shift left by 2.\n\nThis results in: `0.011 x 2^-126`\n\nAt this point, it's easy to convert. The exponent bitstring is 08. You copy the bits after the radix point into the fraction. The sign bit is 0.\n\n\n\n**S** | **Exp** | **Fraction**\n\n`0` `0000 0000` `0110 0000 0000 0000 0000 000`\n\n##No Unsigned Float\n\nUnlike ints, there isn't an unsigned float. One reason for this may be the complicated nature of representing floating point numbers. If we get rid of the sign bit, how would we use it? Would we add one more bit to the exponent? That would make the most sense, since it sits adjacent to the exponent, but the bias would have to be changed.\n\nWe could add one more bit to the fraction. At least, that would cause the least amount of disruption. Would that one additonal bit help us in any meaninful way? On the one hand, it allows us to represent twice as many floating point numbers. On the other, it does so by adding a single bit of precision.\n\nPerhaps through this kind of reasoning, the developers of the IEEE 754 standard felt that having an unsigned float did not make sense, and thus there is no unsigned float in IEEE 754 floating point.\n\n##Why Sign Bit, Exponent, then Fraction?\n\nIf you look at the representation for IEEE 754, you'll notice that it's sign bit, then exponent, then fraction.\n\nWhy do it in that order?\n\nHere's a plausible explanation. Suppose you want to compare two dates. The date includes month, day, and year. You use two digits for the month, two for the day, and four for the year. Suppose you want to store the date as a string, and want to use string comparison to compare dates.\n\nWhich order should you pick?\n\nYou should pick the year, the month, and the day. Why? Because when you are doing string comparison, you compare left to right, and you want the most significant quantity to the left. That's the year.\n\nWhen you look at a floating point number, the exponent is the most important, so it's to the left of the fraction.\n\nYou can also do comparisons because the exponent is written in bias notation (you could use two's complement, as well, although it would make the comparison only a little more complicated).\n\nSo why is the sign bit to the far left? Perhaps the answer is because that's where it appears in signed int representation. It may be unusual to have the sign in any other position.\n\n##Summary\n\nAfter reading and practicing, you should be able to do the following:\n\n* Give the names of each of the five categories of floating point numbers in IEEE 754 single precision.\n* Given a 32 bitstring, determine which category the bitstring falls in.\n* Given a normalized or denormalized number, write the number in canonical binary scientific notation (you can leave the exponent written in base 10).\n* Given a number in base 10 or canonical binary scientific notation, convert it to an IEEE 754 single precision floating point number.\n* Know what bias is used for normalized numbers.\n* Know what exponent is used for denormalized numbers.\n* Know what the hidden 1 is.\n\nSources:\n1.\thttp://www.cs.umd.edu/class/sum2003/cmsc311/Notes/ by Charles Lin, 2003",

Unlike int and unsigned, the set of integers and the set of natural numbers is infinite. Because the set of int is finite, there is a maximum int and a minimum int.</p>\n\n<p>Ints are also contiguous. That is, between the minimum and maximum int, there are no missing values.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"tosummarize\">To summarize:</h4>\n\n<ol>\n<li>The set of valid ints is finite.  </li>\n<li>Therefore, there is a minimum and maximum int.  </li>\n<li>ints are also contiguous. That is, there are no missing integer values between the minimum and maximum int.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>There's also another key feature of ints that doesn't appear in the set of integers. ints have an underlying representation. The representation is binary numbers. The set of integers is often represented as base 10 numerals, but is often thought of more abstractly. That is, the set is independent of its representation (i.e., we can represent the set of integers in any way we want).</p>\n\n<p>What issues comes up when trying to devise a data representation for floating point numbers? It turns out these issues are more complicated than representing integers. While most people agree that UB and 2C are the ways to represented unsigned and signed integers. Representing real numbers has traditionally been more problematic.</p>\n\n<p>In particular, depending on which company manufactured the hardware, there were different ways to represent real numbers, and to manipulate it. There's no particularly obvious choice of how to represent real numbers. In the mid 1980's, the need for uniform treatment of real numbers (called floating point numbers) lead to the IEEE 754 standard.</p>\n\n<p>Standards are often developed to give consistent behavior. For example, when C was first being developed, what was considered a valid C program very much depended on the compiler. A program that compiled on one C compiler might not compile on another. Effectively, many different flavors of C were being created, and the need to have a standard definition of a language was seen as important.</p>\n\n<p>Similar, for purposes of agreeing on results performed on floating point numbers, there was a desire to standardize the way floating point numbers were represented.</p>\n\n<p>Before we get to such issues, let's think about what restrictions will have to be imposed on floating point numbers.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Since the number of bits used to represent a floating point number is finite, there must be a maximum float and a minimum float.</p></li>\n<li><p>However, since real numbers are dense (i.e., between any two distinct real numbers, there's another real number), there's no way to make any representation of real numbers contiguous. Integers do not have this denseness property.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This means we need to decide which real numbers to keep and which ones to get rid of. Clearly, any number that has repeated decimals or never repeats is not something that can be represented as a floating point number.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"scientificnotation\">Scientific Notation</h2>\n\n<p>Why do we need to represent real numbers? Of course, it's important in math. However, real numbers are important for measurements in science.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"precisionvsaccuracy\">Precision vs. Accuracy</h4>\n\n<p>Let's define these two terms:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Definition</strong> <em>Precision</em> refers to the number of significant digits it takes to represent a number. Roughly speaking, it determines how fine you can distinguish between two measurements.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Definition</strong> <em>Accuracy</em> is how close a measurement is to its correct value.</p>\n\n<p>A number can be precise, without being accurate. For example, if you say someone's height is 2.0002 meters, that is precise (because it is precise to about 1/1000 meters). However, it may be inaccurate, because a person's height may be significantly different.</p>\n\n<p>In science, precision is usually defined by the number of significant digits. This is a different kind of precision than you're probably used to. For example, if you have a scale, you might be lucky to have precision to one pound. That is, the error is +/- 1/2 pound. Most people think of precision as the smallest measurement you can make.</p>\n\n<p>In science, it's different. It's about the number of significant digits. For example, <code>1.23 * 10^10</code> has the same precision as <code>1.23 * 10^-10</code>, even though the second quantity is much, much smaller than the first. It may be unusual, but that's how we'll define precision.</p>\n\n<p>When we choose to represent a number, it's easier to handle precision than accuracy. I define accuracy to mean the result of a measured value to its actual value. There's not much a computer can do directly to determine accuracy (I suppose, with sufficient data, use statistical methods to determine accuracy).</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"accuracyofcomputations\">Accuracy of Computations</h2>\n\n<p>There are two distinct concepts: the accuracy of a value that's recorded or measured, and the accuracy of performing operations with numbers.</p>\n\n<p>We can't do much about the accuracy of the recorded value (without additional information). However, the hardware does perform mathematical operations reasonably accurately. The reason the computations aren't perfectly accurate is because one needs infinitely precice math, and that requires an infinite number of bits, which doesn't exist on a computer.</p>\n\n<p>Since floating point numbers can not be infinite precise, there's always a possibility of error when performing computations. Floating point numbers often approximate the actual numbers. This is precisely because floating point numbers can not be infinitely precise.</p>\n\n<p>In the field on computer science, numerical analysis is concerned with ways of performing scientific computations accurately on a computer. In particular, there are ways to minimize the effect of \"round-off errors\", errors that are due to the approximate nature of floating point representation.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"canonicalrepresentation\">Canonical Representation</h2>\n\n<p>When representing numbers in scientific notation, it has the following form:</p>\n\n<pre><code>+/- S x 10^exp\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>where S is the significand or the mantissa, and <strong>exp</strong> is the exponent. \"10\" is the base.</p>\n\n<p>In scientific notation, there can be more than one way of writing the same value. For example, <code>6.02 X 10^23</code> is the same as <code>60.2 X 10^22</code> is the same as <code>602 X 10^21</code>.</p>\n\n<p>For any number represented in this way, there are an infinite number of other ways to represent this (by moving the decimal point, and adjust the exponent).</p>\n\n<p>It might be nice to have a single, consistent way of doing this, i.e. a <em>canonical</em> or standard way of doing this. And, so there is such a way.</p>\n\n<pre><code>+/- D.FFFF X 10^exp\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>You can write the significand as <code>D.FFF...</code> where <code>1 &lt;= D &lt;= 9</code>, and <code>FFF...</code> represents the digits after the decimal point. If you follow this restriction on <code>D</code>, then there's only one way to write a number in scientific notation. The obvious exception to this rule is representing 0, which is a special case.</p>\n\n<p>You can generalize this formula for other bases than base 10. For base K (where <code>K &gt; 1</code>), you write the canonical scientific notation form as:</p>\n\n<pre><code>+/- D.FFFF X Kexp\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>where <code>1 &lt;= D &lt;= K - 1</code>. The F's that appear in the fraction must follow the rule: <code>0 &lt;= D &lt;= K - 1</code>.</p>\n\n<p>The number of <em>significant digits</em>, which is also the <em>precision</em>, is the number of digits after the radix point. We call it the <em>radix point</em> rather than the <em>decimal point</em> because decimal implies base 10, and we could be talking about any other base.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"binaryscientificnotation\">Binary Scientific Notation</h2>\n\n<p>As with any representation on a computer, we need to represent numbers in binary. So, this means we specialize the formula to look like:</p>\n\n<pre><code>+/- D.FFFF X 2exp\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This creates an interesting constraint on <code>D</code>. In particular, <code>1 &lt;= D &lt;= 1</code>, which means <code>D</code> is forced to be 1. We'll use this fact later on.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"ieee754singleprecision\">IEEE 754 Single Precision</h2>\n\n<p>IEEE 754 floating point numbers was a standard developed in the 1980s, to deal with the problem of non-standard floating point representation.</p>\n\n<p>There is a standard for single precision (32 bits) and double precision (64 bits). We'll primarily focus on single precision.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"chart\">Chart</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li><em>Sign</em> - 1 bit - b31 - <code>X</code></li>\n<li><em>Exponent</em> - 8 bits - b30-23 - <code>XXXX XXXX</code></li>\n<li><em>Fraction</em> - 23 bits - b22-0 - <code>XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXX</code></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>An IEEE 754 single precision number is divided into three parts. The three parts match the three parts of a number written in canonical binary scientific notation.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>sign bit</strong> - This is b31. If this value is 1, the number is negative. Otherwise, it's non-negative.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>exponent</strong> - The exponent is excess/bias 127. Normally, one expect the excess/bias to be half the number of representations. In this case, the number of representations is 256, and half of that is 128. Nevertheless, the excess is 127. Thus, the range of possible exponents is <code>-127 &lt;= exp &lt;= 128</code>.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>fraction</strong> - Normally, you would represent the significant (also called the mantissa. This would mean representing <code>D.FFFF....</code> However, recall that for base 2, <code>D = 1</code>. Since <code>D</code> is always 1, there's no need to represent the 1. You only need to represent the bits after the radix point.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Thus, the \"1\" left of the radix point is NOT explicitly represented. We call this the <strong>hidden one</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>IEEE 754 single precision has 24 bits of precision. 23 of the bits are explicitly represented, and the additional \"hidden 1\" is the 24th bit. <br />\nThere is something of a fallacy when we say that a IEEE single precision has 24 bits of precision. In particular, it's very much like saying that a calculator with 15 digits has 15 digits of precision. It's true that it may represent all numbers with 15 digits, but the question is whether the value is really that precise.</p>\n\n<p>For example, suppose a measured number has only 3 digits of precision. There's no way to indicate this on a calculator. The calculator is prepared to have 15 digits of precision, even though that's more accurate than the number.</p>\n\n<p>The same can be said about representing floating point numbers. It has 24 bits of precision, but that may not accurately represent the true number of significant bits. Unfortunately, that's the best computers can do. One could store additional information to determine exactly how many bits really are significant, but this is not usually done.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"categories\">Categories</h2>\n\n<p>Unlike UB or 2C, floating point numbers in IEEE 754 do not all fall in the same category. IEEE 754 identifies 5 different categories of floating point numbers.</p>\n\n<p>You might wonder why they do this. Here's one reason. Given the representation, as is, there would be no way to represent 0. If all the bits were 0, this would be the number 1.0 X 2-127. Although this is a small number, it's not 0.</p>\n\n<p>Thus, we designate the bitstring containing all 0's to be zero.</p>\n\n<p>The following is a list of categories of floating point numbers in IEEE 754.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>zero</strong> Because there is a sign bit, there is a positive and negative representation of 0.</li>\n<li><strong>infinity</strong> There is also a positive and negative infinity. Infinity occurs when you divide a non-zero number by zero. For example, 1.0/0.0 produces infinity.</li>\n<li><strong>NaN</strong> This stands for \"not a number\". NaN usually occurs when you do an ill-defined operation. The canonical example is dividing 0.0/0.0, which does not have a defined value.</li>\n<li><strong>denormalized numbers</strong> These are numbers which have fewer bits of precision, and are smaller (in magnitude) than normalized numbers. We'll discuss denormalized numbers in detail momentarily.</li>\n<li><strong>normalized numbers</strong> These are standard floating point numbers. Most bitstring patterns in IEEE 754 are normalized numbers.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"howtotellwhichcategoryafloatis\">How to Tell Which Category a Float is</h2>\n\n<p>It would be useful to know which category a given a bitstring falls in. Here's the chart.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2015/03/chart-1.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n\n<p>Again, we write <code>0^8</code> to mean 0, repeated 8 times, i.e. <code>0000 0000</code>.</p>\n\n<p>Notice that there is a positive and negative 0.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"denormalizednumbers\">Denormalized Numbers</h2>\n\n<p>Suppose that we allowed all 0's to be a normalized number (it's not though, it's really designated as zero).</p>\n\n<p>A bitstring with 32 zeros would be <code>1.0 X 2^-127</code>. That's a pretty small value. However, we could represent numbers to get even smaller, if we do the following when the exponent is <code>0^8</code>.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Do not have a hidden 1. <code>b(23-0)</code> would be the bits appearing after a radix point.</li>\n<li>Fix the exponent to -126.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Recall that the exponent is written with a bias of 127. So, you would expect that if the exponent is <code>0^8</code>, this bitstring would represent the exponent -127, and not -126. However, there's a good reason why it's -126. We'll explain why in a moment. For now, let's accept the fact that the exponent is -126 whenever the exponent bitstring is <code>0^8</code>.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"largestpositivedenormalizednumber\">Largest Positive Denormalized Number</h4>\n\n<p>What's the largest positive denormalized number? This is when the fraction is <code>1^23</code>.

It's value is -126.</p>\n\n<p>The fraction is <code>(0^22)1</code>, i.e., 22 zeroes followed by a single 1.</p>\n\n<p>This looks like:</p>\n\n<p><strong>S</strong> | <strong>Exp</strong> | <strong>Fraction</strong></p>\n\n<p><code>0</code> <code>0000 0000</code> <code>0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 001</code></p>\n\n<p>This bitstring pattern maps to the number <code>0.(0^22)1 x 2^-126</code>, which is <code>1.0 x 2^-149</code>. This number has 1 bit of precision. The 22 zeroes are merely place holders and do not affect the number of bits of precision.</p>\n\n<p>You may not believe that this number has only 1 bit of precision, but it does. Consider the decimal number 123. This number has 3 digits of precision. Consider 00123. This also has 3 digits of precision. The leading 0's do not affect the number of digits of precision. Similary, if you have 0.000123, the zeroes are merely to place the 123 correctly, but are not significant digits. However, 0.01230 has 4 significant digits, because the rightmost 0 actually adds to the precision.</p>\n\n<p>Thus, for our example, we have 22 zeroes followed by a 1 after the radix point, and the 22 zeroes have nothing to do with the number of significant bits.</p>\n\n<p>By using denormalized numbers, we were able to make the smallest positive float to be <code>1.0 X 2^-149</code>, instead of <code>1.0 X 2^-127</code>, which we would have had if the number had been normalized.</p>\n\n<p>Thus, we were able to go 22 orders of magnitude smaller, by sacrificing bits of precision.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"why126andnot127\">Why -126 and not -127?</h2>\n\n<p>When the exponent bitstring is 08, this is mapped to exponent -126. Yet, for normalized IEEE 754 single precision floating point numbers, the bias on the exponent is -127. Why is it -126 instead of -127.</p>\n\n<p>To answer this question, we need to look at the smallest positive normalized number. This occurs with the following bitstring pattern</p>\n\n<p><strong>S</strong> | <strong>Exp</strong> | <strong>Fraction</strong></p>\n\n<p><code>0</code> <code>0000 0001</code> <code>0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 000</code></p>\n\n<p>This bitstring maps to <code>1.0 x 2^-126</code>. <br />\nLet's look at the two choices for the largest positive denormalized numbers.</p>\n\n<p><code>0.(123) x 2^-127</code> (exponent is 127)</p>\n\n<p><code>0.(123) x 2^-126</code> (exponent is 126---this is what's really used in IEEE 754 single precision)</p>\n\n<p>Both choices are smaller than <code>1.0 x 2^-126</code>, the smallest normalized (In particular, notice that the number with the exponent of -126 is smaller). That's good because we want to avoid overlap between normalized and denormalized numbers.</p>\n\n<p>Also notice that the number with the -126 as exponent is larger than the number that has -127 as exponent (both have the same mantissa/significand, and -126 is larger than -127).</p>\n\n<p>Thus, by picking -126 instead of -127, the gap between the largest denormalized number and the smallest normalized number is smaller. Is this a necessary feature? Is it really necessary to make that gap small? Maybe not, but at least there's some rationale behind the decision.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"convertingnormalizedfrombase10toieee754\">Converting Normalized from Base 10 to IEEE 754</h2>\n\n<p>Let's convert 10.25 from base 10 to IEEE 754 single precision. Here's the steps:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Convert the number left of the radix point to base 2</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><mark>Thus, 10[10] is 1010[2].</mark></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Convert the number right of the radix point to base 2.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><mark>Thus, .25[10] is .01[2].</mark></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Add the two.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><mark>This results in 1010 + 0.01, which is 1010.01.</mark></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Write this in binary scientific notation.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><mark>This is <code>1010.01 X 2^0</code>, which is <code>1.01001 X 2^3</code>.</mark></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Write this in IEEE 754 single precision.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><mark>This is <code>1010.01 X 2^0</code>, which is <code>1.01001 X 2^3</code>.</mark></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Convert 3 to the correct bias. Since the bias is 127, add 127 to 3 to get 130 and convert to binary. This turns out to be <code>1000 0010</code>.</p></li>\n<li><p>Write out the number in the correct representation</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><mark><strong>S</strong> | <strong>Exp</strong> | <strong>Fraction</strong></mark></p>\n\n<p><mark><code>0</code> <code>1000 0010</code> <code>0100 1000 0000 0000 0000 000</code></mark></p>\n\n<p>Notice that the hidden \"1\" is not represented in the fraction.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"analgorithmforwritingpositiveexponentinexcess127\">An Algorithm for Writing Positive Exponent in Excess 127</h2>\n\n<p>Converting 130 to binary seems a bit painful. It seems to require many steps. However, there's a fairly easy way to convert positive exponents to binary.</p>\n\n<p>First, we take advantage of the following fact: <code>1000 0000</code> maps to exponent +1 in excess 127. If this were excess 128, it would map to 0. It would be nice, in fact, if it were excess 128, because then we would write out the positive number in unsigned binary, then flip the most significant bit from 0 to 1, and we'd be done. (Verify this for yourself with an example or two).</p>\n\n<p>However, excess 127 and excess 128 are only off-by-one, so it's not too hard to adjust the algorithm appropriately. Here's what you do to convert positive exponents to excess 127.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Subtract 1 from the positive exponent.</li>\n<li>Convert the number to unsigned binary, using 8 bits.</li>\n<li>Flip the MSb to 1</li>\n<li>For example, we had an exponent of 3 in the previous example. Subtract 1 to get 2, convert to UB to get <code>0000 0010</code>. Flip the MSb to get <code>1000 0010</code>. That's the answer from the previous section.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Before you memorize this algorithm, you should really try to understand where it comes from.</p>\n\n<p>This is where it comes from. Consider a positive exponent, <code>x</code>, represented in base 10. To convert it to excess 127, we add 127. Thus, we have <code>x + 127</code>. We can rewrite this as: (x - 1) + 128. This is simple algebra.</p>\n\n<p>128 is <code>1000 0000</code> in binary. And we have <code>x - 1</code>, which is where the subtraction of 1 occurs. As long as <code>x - 1</code> is smaller than 128 (and it will be, since the maximum value of <code>x</code> is 128), then it's easy to add this binary number to <code>1000 0000</code>.</p>\n\n<p>Remember, memorization is a poor second to understanding. It's better to understand why something works than to memorize an answer. However, it's even better to understand why something works and remember it too.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"convertingdenormalizedfrombase10toieee754\">Converting Denormalized from Base 10 to IEEE 754</h2>\n\n<p>Suppose you're asked to convert <code>1.1 x 2^-128</code> to IEEE 754 single precision. How would you do this? If you're not careful, you might think the number is normalized, and you might convert this to a normalized number using the procedure from before.</p>\n\n<p>You'd get stuck trying to convert the exponent, because you'd discover the number is negative, and the number has to be non-negative when convert from base 10 (after adding the bias) to UB.</p>\n\n<p>You can save yourself this hassle if you recall that the smallest, positive normalized number has an exponent of -126, and that the exponent we have is -128, which is less than -126. If you've written the number in binary scientific notation (in canonical form), and the exponent is less than -126, then you have a denormalized number.</p>\n\n<p>Since <code>-128 &lt; -126</code>, the number we're trying to represent is a denormalized number.</p>\n\n<p>The rules for representing denormalized numbers is different from representing normalized numbers.</p>\n\n<p>To represent a denormalized number, you need to shift the radix point so that the exponent is -126. In this case, the exponent must be increased by 2 from -128 to -126, so the radix point must shift left by 2.</p>\n\n<p>This results in: <code>0.011 x 2^-126</code></p>\n\n<p>At this point, it's easy to convert. The exponent bitstring is 08. You copy the bits after the radix point into the fraction. The sign bit is 0.</p>\n\n<p><strong>S</strong> | <strong>Exp</strong> | <strong>Fraction</strong></p>\n\n<p><code>0</code> <code>0000 0000</code> <code>0110 0000 0000 0000 0000 000</code></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"nounsignedfloat\">No Unsigned Float</h2>\n\n<p>Unlike ints, there isn't an unsigned float. One reason for this may be the complicated nature of representing floating point numbers. If we get rid of the sign bit, how would we use it? Would we add one more bit to the exponent? That would make the most sense, since it sits adjacent to the exponent, but the bias would have to be changed.</p>\n\n<p>We could add one more bit to the fraction. At least, that would cause the least amount of disruption. Would that one additonal bit help us in any meaninful way? On the one hand, it allows us to represent twice as many floating point numbers. On the other, it does so by adding a single bit of precision.</p>\n\n<p>Perhaps through this kind of reasoning, the developers of the IEEE 754 standard felt that having an unsigned float did not make sense, and thus there is no unsigned float in IEEE 754 floating point.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"whysignbitexponentthenfraction\">Why Sign Bit, Exponent, then Fraction?</h2>\n\n<p>If you look at the representation for IEEE 754, you'll notice that it's sign bit, then exponent, then fraction.</p>\n\n<p>Why do it in that order?</p>\n\n<p>Here's a plausible explanation. Suppose you want to compare two dates. The date includes month, day, and year. You use two digits for the month, two for the day, and four for the year. Suppose you want to store the date as a string, and want to use string comparison to compare dates.</p>\n\n<p>Which order should you pick?</p>\n\n<p>You should pick the year, the month, and the day. Why? Because when you are doing string comparison, you compare left to right, and you want the most significant quantity to the left. That's the year.</p>\n\n<p>When you look at a floating point number, the exponent is the most important, so it's to the left of the fraction.</p>\n\n<p>You can also do comparisons because the exponent is written in bias notation (you could use two's complement, as well, although it would make the comparison only a little more complicated).</p>\n\n<p>So why is the sign bit to the far left? Perhaps the answer is because that's where it appears in signed int representation. It may be unusual to have the sign in any other position.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"summary\">Summary</h2>\n\n<p>After reading and practicing, you should be able to do the following:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Give the names of each of the five categories of floating point numbers in IEEE 754 single precision.</li>\n<li>Given a 32 bitstring, determine which category the bitstring falls in.</li>\n<li>Given a normalized or denormalized number, write the number in canonical binary scientific notation (you can leave the exponent written in base 10).</li>\n<li>Given a number in base 10 or canonical binary scientific notation, convert it to an IEEE 754 single precision floating point number.</li>\n<li>Know what bias is used for normalized numbers.</li>\n<li>Know what exponent is used for denormalized numbers.</li>\n<li>Know what the hidden 1 is.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Sources: <br />\n1.    <a href=\"http://www.cs.umd.edu/class/sum2003/cmsc311/Notes/\">http://www.cs.umd.edu/class/sum2003/cmsc311/Notes/</a> by Charles Lin, 2003</p>",

Logging in from my partner's dorm room.\n\nToday I setup a notification for [Lavrsen](http://www.lavrsen.dk/)'s [Motion](http://www.lavrsen.dk/foswiki/bin/view/Motion/WebHome) app that connects to an Android system.\n\nFirst things first, a bit of introduction. \n\n>Motion is a program that monitors the video signal from cameras. It is able to detect if a significant part of the picture has changed; in other words, it can detect motion.\n\n>The program is written in C and is made for the Linux operating system, (using the video4linux interface). Motion is a command line based tool whose output can be either jpeg, ppm fies or mpeg video sequences. Motion is strictly command line driven and can run as a daemon with a rather small footprint and do.\n\nSo yeah we are using this for our [Final Project](http://blog.muhammadmustadi.com/2015/05/26/ta-progress-report-devlog-20150527/)'s webcam integration. There's an email notification built already [using SSMTP and mpack](http://ozzmaker.com/2012/12/03/send-email-from-the-raspberry-pi-or-linux-command-line-with-attachments/) but we'll not cover that this time. Motion is available for streaming, but for reasons, we are only using it's motion-detecting capabilities.\n\nMotion can be set up to execute commands for various triggers, we will use its `on_motion_detected` event listener.\n\nFirst, we will create a nodejs app at `~`to emit camera trigger events to our Socket.io server. We will do this in our Raspberry Pi, but any other systems will do as fine.\n\n$`mkdir /home/pi/camera && cd $_`\n\n$`npm init` (follow through the instructions as you see fit)\n\n$`npm i --save socket.io-client`\n\n$`nano camera.js`\n\ntype the code\n\n```js\n\t\t\n    var io = require('socket.io-client')('http://modulair.muhammadmustadi.com');\n        \n    io.on('connect', function (data) {\n        io.emit('motion_detected', {message: 'motion detected', timestamp: Date.now()})\n    });\n        \n    //exit process after server receives data\n    io.on('motion_received', function (data) {\n        io.disconnect();\n        process.exit();\n    });\n```\n\nand add that to `motion.conf`:\n\n$`sudo nano /etc/motion/motion.conf`\n\n    ...\n    on_motion_detected node /home/pi/camera/camera.js && <other commands such as mpack>\n    ...\n    \n$`sudo reboot` to make the changes take effect.\n\n---\n\nFor the socket.io server, we make some changes.\n\n    // example Express app\n    var app = require('express')();\n    var http = require('http').Server(app);\n    var io = require('socket.io')(http);\n    \n    io.on('connection', function (socket) {\n    // ...\n    socket.on('motion_detected', function (data) {\n        io.emit('motion_notification', data);\n        socket.emit('motion_received', {message: 'motion received.'});\n    });\n    // ...\n    \n\nYou can see that we simply pass the `motion_detected` payload to `motion_notification`, which will be used by the Android client. `motion_received` is then sent back to the one-off node app so that it can close connection and exit the process accordingly.\n\n---\n\nFor the Android App, we will create a socketio-client, event listener, and a simple notification builder. example is my DashboardActivity.\n\n    import com.github.nkzawa.socketio.client.IO;\n    import com.github.nkzawa.socketio.client.Socket;\n    import com.github.nkzawa.emitter.Emitter;\n    \n    // ...\n    \n

      "html": "<p><img src=\"/content/images/2015/05/2015-05-28-012114.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n\n<p>Good evening, everyone in my timezone. Logging in from my partner's dorm room.</p>\n\n<p>Today I setup a notification for <a href=\"http://www.lavrsen.dk/\">Lavrsen</a>'s <a href=\"http://www.lavrsen.dk/foswiki/bin/view/Motion/WebHome\">Motion</a> app that connects to an Android system.</p>\n\n<p>First things first, a bit of introduction. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Motion is a program that monitors the video signal from cameras. It is able to detect if a significant part of the picture has changed; in other words, it can detect motion.</p>\n  \n  <p>The program is written in C and is made for the Linux operating system, (using the video4linux interface). Motion is a command line based tool whose output can be either jpeg, ppm fies or mpeg video sequences. Motion is strictly command line driven and can run as a daemon with a rather small footprint and do.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So yeah we are using this for our <a href=\"http://blog.muhammadmustadi.com/2015/05/26/ta-progress-report-devlog-20150527/\">Final Project</a>'s webcam integration. There's an email notification built already <a href=\"http://ozzmaker.com/2012/12/03/send-email-from-the-raspberry-pi-or-linux-command-line-with-attachments/\">using SSMTP and mpack</a> but we'll not cover that this time. Motion is available for streaming, but for reasons, we are only using it's motion-detecting capabilities.</p>\n\n<p>Motion can be set up to execute commands for various triggers, we will use its <code>on_motion_detected</code> event listener.</p>\n\n<p>First, we will create a nodejs app at <code>~</code>to emit camera trigger events to our Socket.io server. We will do this in our Raspberry Pi, but any other systems will do as fine.</p>\n\n<p>$<code>mkdir /home/pi/camera &amp;&amp; cd $_</code></p>\n\n<p>$<code>npm init</code> (follow through the instructions as you see fit)</p>\n\n<p>$<code>npm i --save socket.io-client</code></p>\n\n<p>$<code>nano camera.js</code></p>\n\n<p>type the code</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">    var io = require('socket.io-client')('http://modulair.muhammadmustadi.com');\n\n    io.on('connect', function (data) {\n        io.emit('motion_detected', {message: 'motion detected', timestamp: Date.now()})\n    });\n\n    //exit process after server receives data\n    io.on('motion_received', function (data) {\n        io.disconnect();\n        process.exit();\n    });\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>and add that to <code>motion.conf</code>:</p>\n\n<p>$<code>sudo nano /etc/motion/motion.conf</code></p>\n\n<pre><code>...\non_motion_detected node /home/pi/camera/camera.js &amp;&amp; &lt;other commands such as mpack&gt;\n...\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>$<code>sudo reboot</code> to make the changes take effect.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>For the socket.io server, we make some changes.</p>\n\n<pre><code>// example Express app\nvar app = require('express')();\nvar http = require('http').Server(app);\nvar io = require('socket.io')(http);\n\nio.on('connection', function (socket) {\n// ...\nsocket.on('motion_detected', function (data) {\n    io.emit('motion_notification', data);\n    socket.emit('motion_received', {message: 'motion received.'});\n});\n// ...\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>You can see that we simply pass the <code>motion_detected</code> payload to <code>motion_notification</code>, which will be used by the Android client. <code>motion_received</code> is then sent back to the one-off node app so that it can close connection and exit the process accordingly.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>For the Android App, we will create a socketio-client, event listener, and a simple notification builder. example is my DashboardActivity.</p>\n\n<pre><code>import com.github.nkzawa.socketio.client.IO;\nimport com.github.nkzawa.socketio.client.Socket;\nimport com.github.nkzawa.emitter.Emitter;\n\n// ...\n\npublic class

      "markdown": "![](/content/images/2015/06/futurism_productimage3.jpg)\n#####intro\nFyeah hello again devs!\n\n![](/content/images/2015/06/2015-06-25-220629.jpg)\n\nAs you all knew, the last two days there was a *big* event being held near me. Can you guess?\n\nYeah, It's [Echelon Asia Summit 2015](http://e27.co/echelon/asia/).\n\nI didn't come though. Oh well but yeah. I then spent my 2 days researching how to integrate my [Home Automation API](http://blog.muhammadmustadi.com/2015/02/10/modulair-development/) to our team's Slack. And I successfully did it. Without further ado, let's get to *the point* now.\n\n**tl;dr: don't be discouraged to try and create slack bots, it's not as hard as it seems. see how I did it below.**\n\n#####the point\n\n![](/content/images/2015/06/------slack.png)\n\nSo yeah. Slack, as you all know, is a\n\n>... real-time messaging, archiving and search for modern teams.\n\n(If you haven't tried it for your team, you should.)\n\nOur team at [Kolaborasi](http://kolaborasi.co) uses it for communications. And Slack opens its API for *a bunch* of [integrations](https://slack.com/integrations), including possibilities for webhooks and **Bots**.\n\nBot users are interesting, because they listen to every messages in its channel, and then decide if they should do anything with it or not.\n\nThere were several libraries to implement bots in NodeJS.\n\n- https://github.com/xoxco/node-slack\n- https://github.com/trinchan/slackbot\n- https://github.com/slackhq/node-slack-client\n- https://github.com/xBytez/slackbotapi\n\nbut I fell in love with the last two, and after experimenting, I chose the last one because of its simplicity.\n\n###### working principle\n\nSo Slack seems to be built over WebSocket. (CMIIW)\n\nSo **after** authenticating, our bot needs to listen to the `'message'` event broadcasted by the Websocket server and then decide what to do based on the payload.\n\nOur bot then will have to make a `http` request to the outside server, and then based on the response (`200`/`404`/else) send a message back to its Slack channel.\n\n###### how we're going to do it\n\nWe're going to use `slackbotapi` npm package fo all things slack and `request` for http request.

Can you guess?</p>\n\n<p>Yeah, It's <a href=\"http://e27.co/echelon/asia/\">Echelon Asia Summit 2015</a>. I was going to attend too (as a visitor, of course) but for some miscommunication and other things, I could not accompany my work partner <a href=\"https://twitter.com/adryanhafizh\">@adryanhafizh</a> who went there.</p>\n\n<p>Oh well but yeah. I then spent my 2 days researching how to integrate my <a href=\"http://blog.muhammadmustadi.com/2015/02/10/modulair-development/\">Home Automation API</a> to our team's Slack. And I successfully did it. Without further ado, let's get to <em>the point</em> now.</p>\n\n<p><strong>tl;dr: don't be discouraged to try and create slack bots, it's not as hard as it seems. see how I did it below.</strong></p>\n\n<h5 id=\"thepoint\">the point</h5>\n\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2015/06/------slack.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n\n<p>So yeah. Slack, as you all know, is a</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>... real-time messaging, archiving and search for modern teams.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>(If you haven't tried it for your team, you should.)</p>\n\n<p>Our team at <a href=\"http://kolaborasi.co\">Kolaborasi</a> uses it for communications. And Slack opens its API for <em>a bunch</em> of <a href=\"https://slack.com/integrations\">integrations</a>, including possibilities for webhooks and <strong>Bots</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>Bot users are interesting, because they listen to every messages in its channel, and then decide if they should do anything with it or not.</p>\n\n<p>There were several libraries to implement bots in NodeJS.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/xoxco/node-slack\">https://github.com/xoxco/node-slack</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/trinchan/slackbot\">https://github.com/trinchan/slackbot</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/slackhq/node-slack-client\">https://github.com/slackhq/node-slack-client</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/xBytez/slackbotapi\">https://github.com/xBytez/slackbotapi</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>but I fell in love with the last two, and after experimenting, I chose the last one because of its simplicity.</p>\n\n<h6 id=\"workingprinciple\">working principle</h6>\n\n<p>So Slack seems to be built over WebSocket. (CMIIW)</p>\n\n<p>So <strong>after</strong> authenticating, our bot needs to listen to the <code>'message'</code> event broadcasted by the Websocket server and then decide what to do based on the payload.</p>\n\n<p>Our bot then will have to make a <code>http</code> request to the outside server, and then based on the response (<code>200</code>/<code>404</code>/else) send a message back to its Slack channel.</p>\n\n<h6 id=\"howweregoingtodoit\">how we're going to do it</h6>\n\n<p>We're going to use <code>slackbotapi</code> npm package fo all things slack and <code>request</code> for http request. Install the dependencies using</p>\n\n<p><code>npm i --save slackbotapi request</code></p>\n\n<p>and start editing our file, <code>servant.js</code>.

      "markdown": "Scraping the web is one of the oldest job since the birth of the internet. This time, I will show you how to scrape, while also showing you how I got the data of **every** rooms in my campus (including empty ones) and their exact position in the floor they are in (using polygons).\n\n# The Problem\n\nMy campus (Institut Teknologi Bandung) has already made an online directory of rooms, located on http://petakampus.itb.ac.id. But it's sluggish and requires Google Earth plugin (which is only available on Firefox and IE 32 bit (and not **Google** Chrome)). YAWN.\n\n![](/content/images/2016/08/2016-08-12-221747_1366x768_scrot.png) Fig. 1\n\nThey even have the indoor maps using polygons as I said above.\n\n![](/content/images/2016/08/72-Labtek-VI-Dapur.png) Fig. 2\n\n# The Solution\n\nFirst of all, here's a rule you should remember. *Everything that can be accessed via the browser, can be crawled.* We just need to know the structure of the data. Check everywhere, thoroughly.\n\n## Step 1: Know Its Structure\n\nOpen the website (if you want to crawl a website) and view the source. `F12` in Chrome, for example. For some websites the data is available in plaintext inside the `<body>` tag.\n\n![](/content/images/2016/08/2016-08-12-211724_1366x768_scrot.png) Fig. 3\n\n\nBut sometimes, website like `petakampus` uses a plugin (e.g Maps, Google Earth) which can not be crawled by plaintext.\n\n![](/content/images/2016/08/2016-08-12-224151_1366x768_scrot.png) Fig. 4\n\nYou have to realize that the plugin **must** be initialized by something. Usually that something is a `<script>` inside the `<head>` tag.\n\n![](/content/images/2016/08/2016-08-12-224752_1366x768_scrot.png) Fig. 5: Voila! Polygons!\n\n## Step 2: Craft the Scraper\n\nThere are many tools to scrape with. We are going to use NodeJS tools since they have handy DOM selectors.\n\nThere's a fast and slim scraper named [`Osmosis`](https://github.com/rchipka/node-osmosis), and also the **HUGE** Electron-based scraper (can even screenshoot) [`Nightmare`](https://github.com/segmentio/nightmare). We will use the middleground for this one, the familiar [`Cheerio`](https://github.com/cheeriojs/cheerio).\n\nWe also need HTTP Client for this. I am choosing [`Axios`](https://github.com/mzabriskie/axios) since it is `Promise` based.\n\n`$ npm i --save axios cheerio`\n\nFirst we will craft the scraper for the list of rooms in [Fig.3]. Each room is in a table data `<td>` tag. Perfect! ☺ \n\n```js\nconst axios = require('axios')\nconst cheerio = require('cheerio')\n\nconst url = 'http://petakampus.itb.ac.id/search/search_map.php'\nconst rooms = []\n\naxios.get(url).then((response) => {\n  var $ = cheerio.load(response.data);\n  $('td').each((i, elm) => {\n    let child = $(elm).children().first()\n...\n```\nYay for data! But the room name and building name is polluted with chevron and unneeded spaces!\n```js\n...\n    let childText = child.text().split('»').join('').slice(1).split(', ')\n    let name = childText.slice(0, -1).join(', ')\n    let building = childText[childText.length - 1]\n...\n```\nCool! Now we parse the room's metadata from its `onClick` attribute.\n```js\n...\n    let attrib = child.attr('onclick').split('javascript:lookat2(').join('').split(')').join('').split(', ').join(',').split(',')\n    // The lat and lon here is just the general position of the building the room is in.\n    let room = {\n      name,\n      building,\n      lat: attrib[0],\n      lon: attrib[1],\n      alt: attrib[2],\n      heading: attrib[3],\n      tilt: attrib[4],\n      range: attrib[5],\n      buildingId: attrib[6],\n      floorId: attrib[7],\n      gId: attrib[8],\n      roomId: attrib[7] + attrib[8]\n    }\n    rooms.push(room)\n  })\n  return rooms\n})\n```\n\n`rooms` is now an array of all room listed there. Not bad, right? Now for the harder part. We will scrape a Google Earth plugin like shown in [Fig. 5]. I will assume you already made an array of `floors` made from the data we scrape above.\n\n```js\n.then(obj => {\n  let { floors } = obj\n  let validatedRoomPolygons = []\n\n  return axios.all(floors.map(floor => {\n    return promiseThrottle.add(() => axios.get(baseUrl + `lantai_gmap2.php?id_gedung=${floor.buildingId}&id_lantai=${floor.id}&gid=${floor.rooms[0].gId}`)).then(response => {\n      let $ = cheerio.load(response.data)\n...\n```\nWait. The data is inside a `<script>` tag. So we need to parse the script as `String`, iterate over all `var triangleCoords`, and skip the first index (before the first `var triangleCoords`) because it does not contain any data.\n\nPS: `promiseThrottle` is used to throttle the request since the `petakampus` server will refuse >15 request per second.\n```js\n...\n      let rawPolygons = $('script')[1].children[0].data.split('var triangleCoords = [\\r\\n           \\r\\n        \\r\\n').slice(1)\n      let parsedPolygons = rawPolygons.map(rawPolygon => {\n        let newPolygon = {\n          type: 'polygon',\n          name: rawPolygon.split('document.getElementById(\\'ifk\\').innerHTML = \\'')[1].split('\\';')[0],\n          buildingName: floor.buildingName,\n\n          buildingId: floor.buildingId,\n          floorId: floor.id,\n          coordinates: rawPolygon.split('    \\r\\n    ];')[0].split('new google.maps.LatLng(').filter((elm, i) => {\n            return i > 0\n          }).map((coordString, i) => {\n            return coordString.split('),')[0].split(',').map((coordNumber) => {\n              let realNumber = Number(coordNumber)\n              return realNumber\n            })\n          }).filter((coordinate) => {\n            return ((coordinate[0] != null) && (coordinate[1] != null))\n          })\n        }\n        return newPolygon\n      })\n      validatedRoomPolygons.push(parsedPolygons.slice(-1)[0])\n      return {floorId: floor.id, buildingId: floor.buildingId, polygons: parsedPolygons.slice(0, -1)}\n    }).catch(reason => {\n      console.log(reason)\n      console.log(floor.id)\n    })\n  }))\n\n```\n\nYay! It's apparently not that hard, we just need to be careful in `slice`, `split`, and `join`ing the script string.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nSeeing the example above, one could use the knowledge to further scrape for more data. I have personally collected the geo data from above and made it available to access in http://campusmap.mustadi.xyz. The source is available in https://github.com/mathdroid/campusmap.\n\nSo now I am building the map client for Android and iOS using React Native. Those who want to contribute, please contact me! Or make a PR in the repo. (The server is using `Koa`, but still uses `mongo` for the DB. Migrating help to `Postgres` is highly appreciated.) 😉 \n\nHope this helps, and happy scraping!\n\n<a class=\"github-button\" href=\"https://github.com/mathdroid\" data-count-href=\"/mathdroid/followers\" data-count-api=\"/users/mathdroid#followers\" data-count-aria-label=\"# followers on GitHub\" aria-label=\"Follow @mathdroid on GitHub\">Follow @mathdroid</a>\n<a class=\"github-button\" href=\"https://github.com/mathdroid/campusmap\" data-icon=\"octicon-star\" data-count-href=\"/mathdroid/campusmap/stargazers\" data-count-api=\"/repos/mathdroid/campusmap#stargazers_count\" data-count-aria-label=\"# stargazers on GitHub\" aria-label=\"Star mathdroid/campusmap on GitHub\">Star mathdroid/campusmap</a>",

      "slug": "asynchronous-functions-or-what-roving-food-stalls-can-learn-from-javascript",
      "markdown": "*Asynchronous Functions. Callbacks. Promises.* **What the heck are these?** I asked myself that question several years ago, when I was still new to JavaScript. I came from the *nice, predictable,* and *Synchronous* world of embedded systems (think Arduino and low-level circuitry) and I was flabbergasted at first. I've since managed to understand the concept and now I will try to explain with simple examples to those who haven't.\n\n# Pedagang Mie Keliling\n\n![](/content/images/2016/08/bakso.jpeg)\n\n\nImagine a roving noodle stall. (Or those of you not familiar with these, imagine an Ice Cream Truck which serves the ice cream on plates, silverware included.) The stall has two methods, which are `findCustomers()` and `serveCustomers()`. \n\n`findCustomers()` move the stall 50m forward and generate noise to call customers, returning `true` if anyone comes. \n\n`serveCustomers()` makes it stop by a while to serve those customers (and those in the general area) and wait until the customers are finished to take back the plates and silverware.\n\n\n\nAnd that, is our example application.\n\n# Synchronous Code\n\nIf you are keen enough, maybe you can already see that most of those stalls operate synchronously. We'll try to put those in code terms.\n\n```js\nlet isOpen = true\nlet customerFound = false\n\nwhile (isOpen) {\n  if (!customerFound) {\n    customerFound = findCustomers()\n  } else {\n    serveCustomers()\n    customerFound = false\n  }\n}\n```\n\nlet me remind you that `findCustomers()` and `serveCustomers()` are both **sync** methods. Those of you familiar with Arduino might see the polling nature of the app resembles Arduino's `loop()` function.\n\nFirst of all. This code **works**. It's good enough for the stalls. But **what if?** What if there's another customer, hungry for noodles, 100m ahead while the stall is in serving mode? That other customer would simply not get served until the current ones are finished. Tasks like these are called **blocking** or **synchronous**.\n\nIn an application UI (or browser) that behavior is not expected at all. We can't have our program go around the UI asking the question \"has this button been clicked\" (has the customers finished their meal) and \"has this button been clicked\" and so on. This ties up resources looping around the UI just checking in case something has happened. \n\nThis isn't how most UI frameworks organize things. Instead they implement an event handling system. The user clicking a button is defined as an event and you can associate code with each event - the event handler. When the event occurs the event handler is run. \n\nThis is such a familiar pattern that we hardy give it a second thought but you should. For example, suppose there are three buttons on the screen and the user clicks on all three at high speed - do three different event handlers get started? \n\nIn most cases the answer is no, only one event handler is started at a time. The most common event handling architecture is single threaded - that is it only has one thread of execution and at any one time only one instruction in your entire program is being obeyed, which is analogous to our stall can only serve a customer at a time.\n\n# Asynchronous Code\n\nSynchronous functions are generally not a big problem because we have fast computers, and most event handlers are executed instantly.\n\nBut what about long-running tasks, like fetching data from third-party servers, and API calls? And for our stall, the serving part?\n\nThis is where **async** functions come in. While **sync** functions require our stall to wait until their completions, **async** tasks can be started and then put aside until later, while our stall proceeds to the next steps of the program.\n\nConsider a function `asyncServeCustomers(callback)`.\n\n```js\nfunction asyncServeCustomers (cb) {\n  makeAndGiveNoodleToCustomers()\n  cb()\n}\n```\n\nand we run it like this:\n\n```js\nlet isOpen = true\n\nfunction finishedEating () {\n  // Call the stall to notify, or return the plates \n  // with drones, or whatever.\n}\n\nwhile (isOpen) {\n  if (findCustomers()) {\n    asyncsServeCustomers(finishedEating)\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThink of it like our stall serves the meal with a piece of paper with a link to trackable GPS coordinate of our stall (for the customers to return our plates) or at least a number to call to after they finish eating. Our driver can then stroll back down there and get the plates.\n\nNow our stall can continue roving after it serves the meal to the customer, without having to wait for **those annoying customers who eat so damn slow** (like me) and serve other potential customers instead.\n\n# Promises\n\n> What about promises??\n\nIf you’ve done any serious work in JavaScript, you have probably had to face callbacks, nested inside of callbacks, nested inside of callbacks. \n\n![](/content/images/2016/08/promises-and-chaining-in-angularjs-into-callback-hell-and-back-again-17-638.jpg)\n\nPromises, like callbacks, provide a way to deal with deferred work. (Returning the result of query to the client when it comes back from the database, or waiting the for customers to eat.) \n\nThe main advantage of a promise over a callback is that you have an instance of an object that represents that deferred work. Let's say for example that you wanted to do two things in parallel after some asynchronous action. With callbacks, you would have to create a new callback that managed that flow. With promises, you can get a promise from the first action and pass it to methods that do the next action and get promises back.\n\nIt is not much different since in JavaScript, Promises use callback functions to specify what to do after a Promise has been resolved or rejected.\n\n```js\nfunction asyncServeCustomers (customer) {\n  return new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {\n    var noodle = new Noodle()\n    noodle.onfinished = function () {\n      resolve(customerLocation)\n    }\n    noodle.onerror = function () {\n      reject(customerLocation)\n    }\n  })\n}\n\n```\n\nWhere `resolve` and `reject` are callbacks to handle async events.\n\n```js\n...\nlet curLoc = [LAT, LON]\n...\n\n  asyncServeCustomer(curLoc).then(function (location) {\n    console.log(`customer in ${location} finished eating!`)\n  }).catch(function (location) {\n    console.log(`there's an error in customer ${location}!`)\n  })\n``` \nRegardless of the number of actions to process the `curLoc`, the level of callback functions used stays at one, which is a lot more maintainable and readable then using callback functions alone. \n\nI would say the biggest advantage is that it can lead to cleaner simpler code which is easier to test and maintain.\n\n\n# Conclusion\n\nAnd that is asynchronous code. There are many other resources which can explain it better than me but at least we can confirm here that the workflow of food stalls can learn a lot from Javascript.\n\nThere is still much to be explained, like Event Loop mentioned above, but it will be a subject for another post.

      "html": "<p><em>Asynchronous Functions. Callbacks. Promises.</em> <strong>What the heck are these?</strong> I asked myself that question several years ago, when I was still new to JavaScript. I came from the <em>nice, predictable,</em> and <em>Synchronous</em> world of embedded systems (think Arduino and low-level circuitry) and I was flabbergasted at first. I've since managed to understand the concept and now I will try to explain with simple examples to those who haven't.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"pedagangmiekeliling\">Pedagang Mie Keliling</h1>\n\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2016/08/bakso.jpeg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n\n<p>Imagine a roving noodle stall. (Or those of you not familiar with these, imagine an Ice Cream Truck which serves the ice cream on plates, silverware included.) The stall has two methods, which are <code>findCustomers()</code> and <code>serveCustomers()</code>. </p>\n\n<p><code>findCustomers()</code> move the stall 50m forward and generate noise to call customers, returning <code>true</code> if anyone comes. </p>\n\n<p><code>serveCustomers()</code> makes it stop by a while to serve those customers (and those in the general area) and wait until the customers are finished to take back the plates and silverware.</p>\n\n<p>And that, is our example application.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"synchronouscode\">Synchronous Code</h1>\n\n<p>If you are keen enough, maybe you can already see that most of those stalls operate synchronously. We'll try to put those in code terms.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">let isOpen = true  \nlet customerFound = false\n\nwhile (isOpen) {  \n  if (!customerFound) {\n    customerFound = findCustomers()\n  } else {\n    serveCustomers()\n    customerFound = false\n  }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>let me remind you that <code>findCustomers()</code> and <code>serveCustomers()</code> are both <strong>sync</strong> methods. Those of you familiar with Arduino might see the polling nature of the app resembles Arduino's <code>loop()</code> function.</p>\n\n<p>First of all. This code <strong>works</strong>. It's good enough for the stalls. But <strong>what if?</strong> What if there's another customer, hungry for noodles, 100m ahead while the stall is in serving mode? That other customer would simply not get served until the current ones are finished. Tasks like these are called <strong>blocking</strong> or <strong>synchronous</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>In an application UI (or browser) that behavior is not expected at all. We can't have our program go around the UI asking the question \"has this button been clicked\" (has the customers finished their meal) and \"has this button been clicked\" and so on. This ties up resources looping around the UI just checking in case something has happened. </p>\n\n<p>This isn't how most UI frameworks organize things. Instead they implement an event handling system. The user clicking a button is defined as an event and you can associate code with each event - the event handler. When the event occurs the event handler is run. </p>\n\n<p>This is such a familiar pattern that we hardy give it a second thought but you should. For example, suppose there are three buttons on the screen and the user clicks on all three at high speed - do three different event handlers get started? </p>\n\n<p>In most cases the answer is no, only one event handler is started at a time. The most common event handling architecture is single threaded - that is it only has one thread of execution and at any one time only one instruction in your entire program is being obeyed, which is analogous to our stall can only serve a customer at a time.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"asynchronouscode\">Asynchronous Code</h1>\n\n<p>Synchronous functions are generally not a big problem because we have fast computers, and most event handlers are executed instantly.</p>\n\n<p>But what about long-running tasks, like fetching data from third-party servers, and API calls? And for our stall, the serving part?</p>\n\n<p>This is where <strong>async</strong> functions come in. While <strong>sync</strong> functions require our stall to wait until their completions, <strong>async</strong> tasks can be started and then put aside until later, while our stall proceeds to the next steps of the program.</p>\n\n<p>Consider a function <code>asyncServeCustomers(callback)</code>.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">function asyncServeCustomers (cb) {  \n  makeAndGiveNoodleToCustomers()\n  cb()\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>and we run it like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">let isOpen = true\n\nfunction finishedEating () {  \n  // Call the stall to notify, or return the plates \n  // with drones, or whatever.\n}\n\nwhile (isOpen) {  \n  if (findCustomers()) {\n    asyncsServeCustomers(finishedEating)\n  }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Think of it like our stall serves the meal with a piece of paper with a link to trackable GPS coordinate of our stall (for the customers to return our plates) or at least a number to call to after they finish eating. Our driver can then stroll back down there and get the plates.</p>\n\n<p>Now our stall can continue roving after it serves the meal to the customer, without having to wait for <strong>those annoying customers who eat so damn slow</strong> (like me) and serve other potential customers instead.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"promises\">Promises</h1>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>What about promises??</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If you’ve done any serious work in JavaScript, you have probably had to face callbacks, nested inside of callbacks, nested inside of callbacks. </p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2016/08/promises-and-chaining-in-angularjs-into-callback-hell-and-back-again-17-638.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n\n<p>Promises, like callbacks, provide a way to deal with deferred work.

      "markdown": "Wasn't an easy decision, but I just removed my LVM partition for you, Arch Linux.\n\nSorry I had to do this. You were definitely one of the best OS I've ever used. (And I'm going to miss your package manager and AUR, oh god.) Sure, tinkering with dotfiles, trying all sort of window managers were damn fun. But I think I need to move on to, you know, more ‘stable’ OS.\n\nOops. Didn’t mean to say you were unstable. Indeed, you were only unstable after I installed packages and tried configs without me learning about them, and even then, it can be easily fixed after we spent the time.\n\nBut that’s exactly it, I don’t have the time anymore. I don’t have the time to think ‘I wonder what are the configs for this app/package’, or ‘how do I extend this app to do what I want’, even though I loved to do it. Truly, I do. I wish I have the time.\n\nThese past 3 months I’ve been using you in a new hardware, 2015 MBPR. Yes, I double-timed you with OS X. This wasn’t like the time when I did it with Windows, though. I prefer you over what Windows can give me. I just used it, sometimes, for my games that were still there. With OS X? I put you in that machine intentionally, because I really do care about you.\n\nI really wanted you to work. I tried everything.\n\nBut you didn’t. OS X may have its inferior package manager, but it’s still usable. It might not have the amazing customizability like you did, but the ‘prison’ it gave me was made of gold. I actually *did not* have to customize. Everything just works.\n\nAlso, OS X is deeply integrated with the hardware. The track pad? Flawless. Godly amazing. I can do gestures and everything. I tried to make the same config with you, but I found no good enough answer.\n\nAnd the battery management. I still remember those nights comparing the battery life under OS X and you (+ `tlp`). I don’t know if it’s me, but OS X gives me way better battery life every single time. What can I say, but uptime length *does* matter.\n\nAnd recently I have these 2 new accessories. Bluetooth headphones and mouse. I remembered how HARD is it to set up 1 single bluetooth device with you. Was it `blues` or `bluetoothctl`? I can’t even remember what mantras I chanted before to get A2DP work on our last headphones.\n\nAll in all, I’m really sorry. It’s not you. It’s definitely me. If anyone asks me what my favorite Linux distro is, I’ll answer it with you. Every time. But for now, I’m going to work, play, and create stuff with OS X.\n\nWhen later I meet someone with you in a coffee shop, I’ll nod at them and be happy cause they picked the right thing. Maybe I’ll even talk with them about my experiences with you. But until then, I will miss you from far away. You’ll always be in a special place in my life.",
